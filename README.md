# Referalah

## Introduction

Welcome to Referalah! Referalah is a platform that connects people, facilitating friendships, connections, and referrals. Whether you're looking to expand your network, find like-minded individuals, or seek recommendations, Referalah is the place to be.

## Repository Management

To maintain consistency and collaboration, all repositories within Referalah should start from the 'development' branch. This ensures that new features and updates are developed in isolation and can be thoroughly tested before integration. When making contributions, please ensure that your pull requests are directed towards the 'development' branch.

## Getting Started Locally

If you want to set up Referalah locally for development or testing, follow these steps:

### Frontend

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the 'client' directory using the `cd client` command.
3.  Run the development server using `yarn run dev`.

### Backend

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the 'supabase' directory using the `cd supabase` command.
3.  Make sure you have already installed the Supabase CLI.
4.  Start the Supabase development environment using the command provided in the Supabase documentation [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development).

Now you have both the frontend and backend of Referalah up and running locally, allowing you to work on and test your changes effectively. Happy coding!
