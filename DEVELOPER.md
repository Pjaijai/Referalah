## 4.To solve user data cannot be inserted after registration

I'm uncertain about the reason why, but there should be a trigger that inserts user data into the user table after registration. I did execute the migration, but unfortunately, it did not generate the trigger as expected. To address this issue, please run the following SQL command in your local SQL editor:

```line_numbers,js
create or replace function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer set search_path = public
as $$
DECLARE
  username_text TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Extract the username from the email (word before @), limited to 4 characters
  username_text := SUBSTRING(NEW.email FROM 1 FOR POSITION('@' IN NEW.email) - 1);
  IF LENGTH(username_text) > 4 THEN
    username_text := LEFT(username_text, 4);
  END IF;

  -- Append the first 4 characters of the uuid (id) to the username
  username_text := username_text || LEFT(NEW.id::TEXT, 4);

  -- Insert the new user with the generated username
  INSERT INTO public.user (uuid, email, username)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email, username_text);

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
;

-- trigger the function every time a user is created
create or replace trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

### 5.Frontend

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the 'client' directory using the `cd client` command.
3.  Run the development server using `yarn dev`.
4.  Clone `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`.
5.  Find Supabase URL and anon key from Project Setting > API and configure `.env`.

### 6.Backend (local)

1. Install [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#updating-the-supabase-cli)
2. Navigate to the 'supabase' directory using the `cd supabase` command.
3. Run `supabase start`
4. Connect Supabase database to your favourite database IDE/or using supabase local[http://localhost:54323/project/default]. Run [SQL Script](#to-solve-user-data-cannot-be-inserted-after-registration) to insert user data upon registration.
5. Create a [Resend](https://resend.com) account for email sending. Link it to your Supabase project and get an API key.
6. configure your `.env.local`, add your `RESEND_API_KEY` from Resend and use your Resend email account as `RESEND_TO_EMAIL`.
7. To start local edge function, create a `.env.local` at the root of supabase folder. Run command `supabase functions serve --env-file ./supabase/.env.local`.

### 7.Backend Migration

For accurate information, please check supabase local dev doc here[https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development]

# Method A (Github Actions)

1. Create two[new Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects). One for staging and one for production.
2. Go Github > repo > setting > secrets and variables > Actions > adding required variables (Check `production.yml` and `staging.yml`).
3. When you push and changes, github actions should run to migrate files and deploy edge function automatically.
4. Create a bucket called `user_assets` in `Storage`. It seems like cannot be done through migration ? Need to do manually.

# Method B (Commands)

1. Create a [new Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects).
2. Run `supabase login` with your `personal access token` from supabase.
3. Run `supabase link --project-ref [your-supabase-project-id]`.
4. Run `supabase db push` to run migrations on your supabase project.
5. Clone `.env.template` from `supabase/` and rename it to `.env.local`.
6. Every time you make changes to Supabase functions, run `supabase functions deploy --project-ref [your-supabase-project-id]`.

### Creating branch

Naming your branch with category. For example `feature/i-go-to-school-by-bus`. Please create new branch based on `development` branch and created PR point to `development`.

| Category Word |                               Meaning                                |
| ------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| hotfix        | for quickly fixing critical issues,usually with a temporary solution |
| bugfix        |                           for fixing a bug                           |
| feature       |             for adding, removing or modifying a feature              |
| doc           |                               document                               |

### Creating Pull Request

Naming your PR with category. For example `Feature/I Go To School By Bus`

| Category Word |                               Meaning                                |
| ------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| HotFix        | for quickly fixing critical issues,usually with a temporary solution |
