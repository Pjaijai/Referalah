-- trigger the function every time a user is created

```
create or replace trigger on_auth_user_created
after insert on auth.users
for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();

```

## 5.Frontend

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the 'client' directory using the `cd client` command.
3.  Run the development server using `yarn dev`.
4.  Clone `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`.
5.  For non localhost developemnt, find Supabase URL and anon key from Project Setting > API and configure `.env`.
6.  For local development, Run `supabase status` to get the anon key and API URL.
7.  Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`.
8.  `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_URL`= `http://localhost:3000` in `.env`.

## 6.Backend (local)

1. Install [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#updating-the-supabase-cli)
2. Navigate to the 'supabase' directory using the `cd supabase` command.
3. Run `supabase start`
4. Connect Supabase database to your favourite database IDE/or using supabase local[http://localhost:54323/project/default]. Run [SQL Script](#to-solve-user-data-cannot-be-inserted-after-registration) to insert user data upon registration.
5. Create a [Resend](https://resend.com) account for email sending. Link it to your Supabase project and get an API key.
6. Configure your `.env.local`, add your `RESEND_API_KEY` from Resend and use your Resend email account as `RESEND_TO_EMAIL`.
7. To start local edge function, create a `.env.local` at the root of supabase folder. Run command `supabase functions serve --env-file ./supabase/.env.local`.

### 7.Backend Migration

For accurate information, please check supabase local dev doc here[https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development]

# Method A (Github Actions)

1. Create two[new Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects). One for staging and one for production.
2. Go Github > repo > setting > secrets and variables > Actions > adding required variables (Check `production.yml` and `staging.yml`).
3. When you push and changes, github actions should run to migrate files and deploy edge function automatically.
4. Create a bucket called `user_assets` in `Storage`. It seems like cannot be done through migration ? Need to do manually.

# Method B (Commands)

1. Create a [new Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects).
2. Run `supabase login` with your `personal access token` from supabase.
3. Run `supabase link --project-ref [your-supabase-project-id]`.
4. Run `supabase db push` to run migrations on your supabase project.
5. Clone `.env.template` from `supabase/` and rename it to `.env.local`.
6. Every time you make changes to Supabase functions, run `supabase functions deploy --project-ref [your-supabase-project-id]`.
